This is just a fun little ruby / security project I decided to make.
Essentialy its a botnet written in ruby. Albeit a bad one lacking 
security its a fun little project that I built in a weekend.

This is my first ruby project and I have been having a few issues with organization
and file structuring so I have a very informal method of running it right now. 

You run either HerderClient.rb or ZombieClient.rb and it does its magic. Theres no documentation
right now because I am too busy writing the actual code. Anyways don't use my code for evil.
Im too lazy to actually put in a license so don't be a bad guy...
